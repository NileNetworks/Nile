In these sections we show you how to use the various components of
`Nilenetworks`. To follow along, we recommend you clone
the [`Nilenetworks-examples`](https://github.com/Nilenetworks/Nilenetworks-examples) repo.

!!! tip "Consult the tests as well"
    As you get deeper into Nilenetworks, you will find it useful to consult
    the [tests](https://github.com/Nilenetworks/Nilenetworks/tree/main/tests/main)
    folder under `tests/main` in the main Nilenetworks repo.

Start with the [`Setup`](setup.md) section to install Nilenetworks and
get your environment set up.
